The hidden state in position i of the layer k, hi, attends to all hidden states from head_dim hidden_dim n_heads 128 14336 32 the previous layer with positions between i − W and i. Recursively, n_kv_heads 8 hi can access tokens from the input layer at a distance of up to W × k window_size 4096 tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1. At the last layer, using a window size of W = 4096, we have a theoretical attention span of approximately context_len vocab_size 8192 32000 131K tokens. In practice, for a sequence length of 16K and W = 4096, changes made to FlashAttention [11] and xFormers [18] yield a 2x Table 1: Model architecture. speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline.\\n\\n32\\n\\nRolling Buffer Cache. A fixed attention span means that we can limit our cache size using a rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of W, and the keys and values for the timestep i are stored in position i mod W of the cache. As a result, when the position i is larger than W, past values in the cache are overwritten, and the size of the cache stops increasing. We provide an illustration in Figure 2 for W = 3. On a sequence length of 32k tokens, this reduces the cache memory usage by 8x, without impacting the model quality.\\n\\n1https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src 2https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot 3https://huggingface.co/mistralai\\n\\n2\\n\\nTimestep i Timestep i+ 1 Timestep i + 2 This is an example of ...

When the position i is larger than W, past values in the cache are overwritten. The hidden state corresponding to the latest generated tokens are colored in orange.\\n\\nPre-fill and Chunking. When generating a sequence, we need to predict tokens one-by-one, as each token is conditioned on the previous ones. However, the prompt is known in advance, and we can pre-fill the (k, v) cache with the prompt. If the prompt is very large, we can chunk it into smaller pieces, and pre-fill the cache with each chunk. For this purpose, we can select the window size as our chunk size. For each chunk, we thus need to compute the attention over the cache and over the chunk. Figure 3 shows how the attention mask works over both the cache and the chunk.\\n\\nThe cat sat on the mat and saw the dog go to\\n\\nthe dog go to'"

      "Figure 1: Sliding Window Attention. The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer (here, W = 3). Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k × W tokens.\n",

      " Mistral and Llama2 are both transformer-based language models, but they have different architectural features and attention mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistral 7B uses a sliding window attention (SWA) mechanism that allows each token to attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer. This reduces the memory requirement during decoding and allows for higher batch sizes, which is crucial for real-time applications. Mistral 7B also leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) to accelerate inference speed and reduce memory requirements during decoding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Llama2, on the other hand, uses a rolling buffer cache mechanism that limits the cache size using a rolling buffer cache. This reduces the cache memory usage without impacting the model quality. Llama2 also uses pre-fill and chunking to handle large prompts by dividing them into smaller chunks and computing attention over each chunk separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of benchmarks, Mistral 7B outperforms Llama 2 across all tested benchmarks and surpasses the best 34B model (LLaMa 34B) in mathematics and code generation. It also approaches the coding performance of Code-Llama 7B without sacrificing performance on non-code related benchmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistral 7B is released under the Apache 2.0 license, and it is accompanied by a reference implementation that facilitates easy deployment either locally or on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure using the vLLM inference server and SkyPilot 2. Integration with Hugging Face is also streamlined for easier integration. Mistral 7B is crafted for ease of fine-tuning across a myriad of tasks, and it demonstrates its adaptability and superior performance by presenting a chat model fine-tuned from Mistral 7B that significantly outperforms the Llama 2 13B – Chat model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, both Mistral 7B and Llama2 have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they are designed to handle different types of tasks and applications. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. \n"
